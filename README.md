TARA Oceans and ISIMIP Integration

This repository contains the code and resources for a proof-of-principle project to combine marine metagenomic data from the TARA Oceans expedition with environmental model outputs from the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP).

The primary goal is to demonstrate a workflow for integrating these two distinct datasets to investigate potential relationships between marine microbial communities and large-scale climate variables.

## Project Goals

* **Integrate Data:** Combine location-specific TARA Oceans data with corresponding ISIMIP model outputs.
* **Analyze Correlations:** Explore statistical relationships between microbial community composition and environmental parameters from the models.
* **Proof-of-Principle:** Develop a repeatable, well-documented workflow that can be scaled for further research.

## Project Checklist

The following is a checklist of tasks to complete this project.

### **Phase 1: Repository Setup & Planning**

* [x] Initialize Git repository and create an initial commit.
* [x] Write a preliminary `README.md` outlining the project's goal and methodology.
* [x] Create a `LICENSE` file.
* [x] Define a clear folder structure for code, data, and outputs.
* [x] Set up a virtual environment or `Project.toml` file for Julia dependencies.

### **Phase 2: Data Acquisition & Processing**

**TARA Oceans Data**
* [ ] Identify specific Tara Oceans datasets required.
* [ ] Locate and list all direct download URLs for required data.
* [ ] Write a robust Julia script to download all identified Tara Oceans data.
* [ ] Develop a Julia script to process and clean the raw Tara data.

**ISIMIP Model Data**
* [ ] Identify the most relevant ISIMIP model outputs for comparison.
* [ ] Download the selected ISIMIP climate model outputs.
* [ ] Develop a Julia script to subset the ISIMIP data to match the Tara Oceans samples.
* [ ] Reformat the ISIMIP data to be compatible with the Tara Oceans data.

### **Phase 3: Integration & Analysis**

* [ ] Create a Julia notebook or script (`notebooks/analysis.jl`) to load and merge the processed data.
* [ ] Develop a statistical methodology to compare the datasets.
* [ ] Write code to perform the core statistical analysis.
* [ ] Create visualizations to illustrate the proof of principle.

### **Phase 4: Documentation & Finalization**

* [ ] Update the `README.md` with a detailed summary of the methods and initial findings.
* [ ] Add clear comments and documentation to all scripts and notebooks.
* [ ] Create a data description file (`data/README.md`).
* [ ] Clean up the repository and remove any large or unnecessary files.
* [ ] Create a final commit with a summary of the project's success.
